Hi

I want to pull the screen down to refresh the data, and pull the screen up to load the old data. But it has a bit of a problem.

When the screen is pulled down, new data should be viewed at the bottom, but new data is being created at the top.

I know this may not be a "Devexpress" issue.

But I'm so frustrated that as a user of DevExpress, I want to help.

You may or may not respond, but please help.
